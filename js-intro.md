# ASSESSMENT 1: INTRO TO JAVASCRIPT
## Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory. Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn.   

1. What is a function? Why would you use one?

  Your answer: a function is a set of rules that perform operations on certain input to get desirable outputs. Using function can reduce the amount of code by reducing repetitively using the same set of operations.

  Researched answer: 
  "A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task." 
  "Function are used for divide a large code into module, due to this we can easily debug and maintain the code"




2. List 5 examples of JavaScript array methods.

  Your answer: map() reduce() split() join() filter() pop() 

  Researched answer:
    Method	Description
    concat()	Merge two or more arrays, and returns a new array.
    copyWithin()	Copies part of an array to another location in the same array and returns it.
    entries()	Returns a key/value pair Array Iteration Object.
    every()	Checks if every element in an array pass a test in a testing function.
    fill()	Fill the elements in an array with a static value.
    filter()	Creates a new array with all elements that pass the test in a testing function.
    find()	Returns the value of the first element in an array that pass the test in a testing function.
    findIndex()	Returns the index of the first element in an array that pass the test in a testing function.
    forEach()	Calls a function once for each array element.
    from()	Creates an array from an object.
    includes()	Determines whether an array includes a certain element.
    indexOf()	Search the array for an element and returns its first index.
    isArray()	Determines whether the passed value is an array.
    join()	Joins all elements of an array into a string.
    keys()	Returns a Array Iteration Object, containing the keys of the original array.
    lastIndexOf()	Search the array for an element, starting at the end, and returns its last index.
    map()	Creates a new array with the results of calling a function for each array element.
    pop()	Removes the last element from an array, and returns that element.
    push()	Adds one or more elements to the end of an array, and returns the array's new length.
    reduce()	Reduce the values of an array to a single value (from left-to-right).
    reduceRight()	Reduce the values of an array to a single value (from right-to-left).
    reverse()	Reverses the order of the elements in an array.
    shift()	Removes the first element from an array, and returns that element.
    slice()	Selects a part of an array, and returns the new array.
    some()	Checks if any of the elements in an array passes the test in a testing function.
    sort()	Sorts the elements of an array.
    splice()	Adds/Removes elements from an array.
    toString()	Converts an array to a string, and returns the result.
    unshift()	Adds new elements to the beginning of an array, and returns the array's new length.
    values()	Returns a Array Iteration Object, containing the values of the original array.


3. Explain the difference between console.log() and return.

  Your answer: concole.log() print a result but doesn't store the information in memory; return assign the result to an action, such as invocation of a function.

  Researched answer:
  console.log will display the parameter passed to the log method in the console window. 
  Use this method to display a string or variable in the console window.
  When using the return statement, the function will stop executing, and return the specified value.



4. In regards to functions, what is an argument? What is the difference between an argument and a variable?

  Your answer: Arguments are parameters passed in to functions. The difference between arguments and variables is that arguments are intermediates used in functions to get a result that can be stored in variable; they do not exist outside the function but variables can exist anywhere.

  Researched answer: 
  A parameter is a variable in a method definition. When a method is called, the arguments are the data you pass into the method's parameters.
  The term parameter (sometimes called formal parameter) is often used to refer to the variable as found in the function definition, while argument (sometimes called actual parameter) refers to the actual input supplied at function call.
  In computer programming, a variable or scalar is a storage location (identified by a memory address) paired with an associated symbolic name, which contains some known or unknown quantity of information referred to as a value. 


5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the rolls of each person?

  Your answer: 
  There is a driver and a navigator. 
  The driver types and the navigator helps the driver by providing information that may be helpful for the driver to accomplish the task. 

  Researched answer:
    Pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. 
    One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed in. 
    The two programmers switch roles frequently.
    While reviewing, the observer also considers the "strategic" direction of the work, coming up with ideas for improvements and likely future problems to address. 
    This is intended to free the driver to focus all of their attention on the "tactical" aspects of completing the current task, using the observer as a safety net and guide.



6. Give a brief description of JavaScript as if you were explaining it to someone who doesn't know anything about programming.

  Your answer: JavaScript is a scirpting language. 
    "Scripting languages are programming languages used to automate processes that users would otherwise need to execute on their own, step-by-step."
    A scripting language like JavaScript (JS, for those in the know) does the heavy lifting by telling computer programs like websites or web applications to “do something.” 
    In the case of JavaScript, this means telling those dynamic features described earlier to do whatever it is they do
    —like telling images to animate themselves, photos to cycle through a slideshow, 
    or autocomplete suggestions to respond to prompts. It’s the “script” in JavaScript that makes these things happen seemingly on their own.


7. What is one thing we did in class this week you found helpful?  

  Your answer:
    Walking around and read others codes. I learned a great deal how to write more concise code!
